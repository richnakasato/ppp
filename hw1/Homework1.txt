Homework 1
[60 points]

This Homework assignment is meant to give you some experience wri ng rela vely simple C++ programs, using various
data types, and some basic input and output.
All work should be turned into CSNet by the deadline. For programs, you need to turn in only the source code (not object
or executable code). Your code will be tested using g++: you are welcome to develop in Visual Studio, but please make
sure your code also runs in g++.
0) Create a text ﬁle, README, in which you:
a. State the Aggie Honor statement, or else explain why you cannot do so.
b. List any resources used, outside the textbook and discussions with the Instructor, TA, or Peer Teacher
c. List any known problems with the assignments you are turning in. For example, if you know your code
does not run correctly, state that. This does not need to be a long explana on.
1) [20 points] There are 9 posi ons in baseball: Pitcher, Catcher, First Base, Second Base, Shortstop, Third Base,
Right Field, Center Field, Le Field. Write a program that asks for the name (in standard FirstName LastName
format) of players playing each of these posi ons, then outputs a list of the players by posi on, in the form
LastName, FirstName. Format the list so that the Posi ons and Names line up.
a. For example, the program might ask “Who is the Catcher?” and the user enter “Joe Smith”. A er all 9
players are entered, there would be a line printed out that said “Catcher: Smith, Joe”
2) [40+2 points] Write a program that helps a server in a restaurant determine the average ps he or she receives.
a. The program should repeatedly ask for informa on from tables, and output a running set of data. That
is, it should read about one table, then produce output, read about another table, produce output, etc.
b. Input should ask for the number of people at the table, the total bill for the table before p, and the
amount of the p. For example, 4 35.18 6.00 might be input, indica ng a table of 4 with a total bill of
$35.18, and a p of $6.00.
c. A er reading each p, you should output the following:
You have waited on a total of XXXX people at XXXX tables.
The average bill per table is $XXXX, and the average bill per person is $XXXX.
The average p per table is $XXXX, and the average p per person is $XXXX.
The average rate of pping is XXXX%.
The biggest p you received was $XXXX per person at the table.
The smallest p you received was $XXXX per person at the table.
So, a er the line above, you would print out:
You have waited on a total of 4 people at 1 tables.
The average bill per table is $35.18, and the average bill per person is $6.00.
The average p per table is $6.00, and the average p per person is $1.50.
The average rate of pping is 17.06%.
The biggest p you received was $1.50 per person at the table.
The smallest p you received was $1.50 per person at the table.
d. [2 point bonus] You probably no ced that your output does not come out with the right number of
digits. There is no penalty if you have addi onal digits. However, if you can ﬁgure out how to display all
the $ and % numbers with exactly 2 decimal places, you can get a bonus 2 points.
e. Hint: as you code this, work at ge ng just one number at a me correct. Make sure you are able to print
the number of tables correctly. Once you are sure you have that, then add the number of people. Then
try to ﬁnd the average bill per table, etc.
